This script will read off from .txt file which contains macro actions. But currently only supports image-search based macros, no 'wait' or 'keypress' kinda things yet. Will eventually be implemented when I'm out of army. Got motif from android app 'Frep' by strai.

Since 2020/02/29 - rewriting with OOP.

**Current State:**

[Demonstration video - v0.0.1](https://youtu.be/lsix-z5S4LQ)

Can now save-load-play macro without significant issue when only using basic components - ImageSearch / Wait / Click.
Still working on other macro components.

p.s. About sample Image used above, forgot who created her, probably somewhere in DC.
Honestly saying out loud - I'm lovin' it.
