This script will read off from .txt file which contains macro actions. But currently only supports image-search based macros, no 'wait' or 'keypress' kinda things yet. Will eventually be implemented when I'm out of army. Got motif from android app 'Frep' by strai.

Now has separated Macro Editor - Player window. Many functions are not implemented yet.
But basic functions - edit/save/load/play - works without significant issue when only using basic components - ImageSearch / Wait / Click.

Use Pickle to save & load macro sequence.

Still working on other macro components.
