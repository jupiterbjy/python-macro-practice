###### Previous:
This script will read off from .txt file which contains macro actions. But currently only supports image-search based macros, no 'wait' or 'keypress' kinda things yet. Will eventually be implemented when I'm out of army. Got motif from android app 'Frep' by strai.

Example of usage: https://youtu.be/_ichOg5tf8Y

###### New:
Since 2020/02/29 - rewriting with OOP. Should've made new branch, too late. Currently project is not even testable.

Will provide class-based interfaces with OOP approach, with PyQt5 handling UI.
