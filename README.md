#### Introduction
Noob's attempt on language he never learned about.

Currently avg.80 mins per day is allocated for this personal project.

###### Previous:
This script will read off from .txt file which contains macro actions. But currently only supports image-search based macros, no 'wait' or 'keypress' kinda things yet. Will eventually be implemented when I'm out of army. Got motif from android app 'Frep' by strai.

Example of usage: https://youtu.be/_ichOg5tf8Y

###### New:
Since 2020/02/29 - rewriting with OOP. Should've made new branch, too late. Currently project is not testable yet.

Will provide class-based interfaces with OOP approach, with PyQt5 handling UI.

**Current State:**

Basic UI and Sequence Create/Load/Save is working now, and already all necessary run codes for each sequence was ready in first week too.
But since this is UI based approach, not CLI like previous so I can't easily assign those to UI right away.
Will take another week for basic functionality.

About sample Image used above, forgot who created her, probably somewhere in DC.
Honestly saying out loud - I'm lovin' it.
