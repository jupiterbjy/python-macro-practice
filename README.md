# Introduction
Noob's attempt on language he never learned about.

In short, this script will read off from .txt file which contains macro actions. But currently only supports image-search based macros, no 'wait' or 'keypress' kinda things yet. Will eventually be implemented when I'm out of army. Got motif from android app 'Frep' by strai.

Create onefile with pyinstaller from MacroLoader.py & TemplateImageGenerator.py And you're good to go.

Will complete Readme section when I have time to put GUI on this script.
