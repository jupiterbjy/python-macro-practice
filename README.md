# python-macro-practice
Noob's attempt on language he never learned about.

This script reads macro txt file and process it.

Create onefile with pyinstaller from MacroLoader.py And you're good to go.

Currently this hing is in fully working status, but will complete Readme section when I have time to put GUI on this script.
